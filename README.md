<strong>Project: CSS/HTML (Difficult)</strong>

Build Google Search Results Page
Hosted : https://murdens.github.io/google_searchresults/

<strong>Covered:</strong>
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox, tried to avoid use of inline block and floats. Also embeded flexbox within a flexbox for related search items.
- Use of img and href to link related search results.

<strong>Review:</strong>
I think I would plan out grid ahead of build next time, although it is simple to add more sections as required.
I had to watch a number of tutorials on both grid and flexbox to get the project to this stage. 9 days into TOP I'm really happy I got it this far.
I'm now itching to understand how to make the search dynamic so onto the next lessons.
