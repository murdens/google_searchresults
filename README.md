Project: CSS/HTML (Difficult)

Build Google Search Results Page

Covered:

CSS Grid - Planned layout, included empty spaces
Flexbox - tried to avoid use of inline block and floats.
Embeded fLexbox within a flexbox for related search items.
Ue of img and href to link related search results.

Review:
I think I would plan out grid ahead of build next time, although it is simple to add more sections as required.
I had to watch a number of tutorials on both grid and flexbox to get the project to this stage. 9 days into TOP I'm really happy I got it this far.
I'm now itching to understand how to make the search dynamic so onto the next lessons.
